\begin{abstract}
Tonga’s economic structure is marked by a narrow production base, a reliance on imported goods, and a heavy dependence on remittances as a source of foreign exchange. Its exchange rate management is therefore crucial to its economic resilience and stability as it acts as a macroeconomic buffer stabilizing import costs and the economy's sensitivity towards external shocks. Several economic features such as Tonga's monetary policy stance, fiscal discipline, existing trade partners, history of inflation, and macroprudential policies are salient to an effective exchange rate policy. This paper attempts to capture Tonga's exchange rate policy stance and recommend strategies for future integration.



%Global events—such as financial crises, commodity price shocks, or shifts in international capital flows—can further amplify the significance of the exchange rate system a country adopts. The choice between fixed, floating, or intermediate regimes is therefore not just a technical decision, but a reflection of broader policy priorities and institutional capacities. These regimes shape how economies absorb external shocks, influence investor confidence, and affect competitiveness in international markets. In turn, they have lasting consequences for economic stability, growth prospects, and integration into the global economy.
%The purpose of the travel was to attend a seminar on ‘ST25.36 Exchange Rate Policy’, organised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in partnership with the Singapore Training Institute (STI). The seminar aimed to strengthen the officer’s capacity to diagnose and analyze exchange rate regimes contextualized in countries with different economic features (fiscal discipline, monetary policy stance, trade balance, history of inflation etc). The interaction of these features with the exchange rate have massive implications for the external position of the country.

\section{General Information}
\subsection{Introduction}

The National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) oversees the management of exchange rate movements  - with its mandate being to maintain (internal and external) monetary stability; to which it conducts activities in such a manner that supports macroeconomic stability and economic growth. 

\noindent For internal monetary stability, the Reserve Bank targets low and stable inflation over the medium term - a maintenance of inflation below the 5\% reference rate set by the NRBT.
For external monetary stability, an adequate amount of foreign currencies (foreign reserves) to meet the country's foreign currency demands to pay for imports and other obligations. As such, the Reserve Bank's monetary policies aim to ensure that Tonga always has foreign reserve holdings of at least three to four months of import cover.
%\subsection{Organiser Information}

%The IMF – Singapore Regional Training Institute (STI), is the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) regional training center for the Asia and Pacific region. It provides government officials from 38 countries with training and technical assistance in macroeconomic and financial management and related legal and statistical issues. Most training takes place in two-week seminars, with shorter events organized for senior officials.


\section{Tonga's Exchange Rate Regime}
\subsection{To peg or not to peg}
Tonga's official currency is the \textit{Tongan Pa'anga}. As per the IMF, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is a \textbf{pegged exchange rate - within horizontal bands} (\textit{see Fig 1}). The external value of the pa'anga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket (comprising the US dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Fijian dollar) - with the respective basket weights being determined by the proportions of trade with these partners.

\noindent The bipolar view on XR regime choice, prevalent in the late 1900s, argued that only hard pegs or free floats were viable. This was reinforced by evidence during emerging market crises (such as in Asia 1997-98, Russia 1998, Argentina 2001), which found intermediate regimes (or soft pegs) were easily vulnerable to speculative attacks and capital mobility.


\noindent However, recent studies show the evolution of exchange rate regimes has disrupted the consensus and acknowledges the choice of regime is based on a country's level of financial development, credibility and exposure to shock. For Tonga, a soft peg offers the following benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Tonga is both a net importing and remittance-dependent country. A soft peg \textbf{stabilizes the exchange rate} and acts as a buffer for other forms of economic instability. For importers, it stabilizes the cost of essential goods. For families, it stabilizes the value of remittances sent home.

    \item Tonga has a very small and underdeveloped financial system. According to the AREAER (2024), there are no deep foreign exchange markets or sophisticated hedging instruments (like futures or options) that businesses could use to protect themselves against currency fluctuations.

The EBA-lite CA model estimates the adjusted CA balance at -8.0 percent of GDP and the 
adjusted CA norm at -8.0 percent of GDP. With a gap close to 0 percent of GDP, the external position in 
FY2024 is assessed to be broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (text table). 
The policy gap (4.2 percent of GDP) primarily reflects the relatively looser fiscal policy in the rest of the 
world


\section{Early Warning System for Crises}
\subsection{Constructing the Exchange Market Pressure index}

Financial crises (currency, banking, or debt) are costly. The Early Warning System acts as a surveillance tool to identify vulnerabilities (in country fundamentals) and triggers (econonmic shocks) that could lead to crises episodes. This system utilizes regression analysis to predict crises, but first requires the construction of a binary dependent variable that signals (1) for a crisis and (0) otherwise.

\noindent \: \: The \textbf{Exchange Market Pressure (EMP)} index will be used for this dependent variable construction:

$$EMP = \frac{\Delta e}{e} - \frac{\sigma_{e}}{\sigma_{fx}} \left(\frac{\Delta fxr}{fxr}\right),$$

\noindent which notes $\frac{\Delta e}{e}$ as the percentage change in nominal exchange rate (e) , $\left(\frac{\Delta fxr}{fxr}\right)$ as the percentage change in foreign exchange reserves (fxr), with $\sigma_{e}$ and $\sigma_{fxr}$ as the respective volatility of (e) and (fxr). 

\noindent This EMP index is converted to a crisis indicator (c) - equal to 1 for a crisis, and 0 for a tranquil period - considering the movements of the EMP index with respect to the historical mean and standard deviation. Mathematically, this is represented as:

  \begin{equation*}
   %     \text{Is \(b_{i+1}\leqslant b_i\) \& \(\lim_{i\to\infty}b_i=0\)?}\:
   c \rightarrow
        \begin{cases}
            \text{1}, & EMP > \mu_{EMP} + \varphi \sigma_{EMP} \\
            \text{0},  & EMP \leq \mu_{EMP} + \varphi \sigma_{EMP}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

where $\mu_{EMP}$ is the sample mean and $\sigma_{EMP}$ is the sample standard deviation. The $\varphi$ is chosen arbritrarily ( $1.5<\varphi <3$ ), keeping in mind not to set it too high (as to incur type 2 errors and miss crisis episodes) or to set it too low (and to incur type 1 errors and issue false alarms). 

\subsection{Historical financial Crises}
For Tonga, data from January 2012 to May 2025 has been collected for both nominal exchange rates (e) (in USD) and foreign reserves (fxr), which yielded the following calculations:


    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{llllll}
          \toprule
            \sigma_{e}  &  \sigma_{fxr}  &  \mu_{emp}  & \mu_{emp}  & \varphi \\
            \midrule
            1.05  &  3.16   &   -0.43   &  1.12   & 1.85 \\
            \bottomrule

    \end{table}

The historical data marks \textbf{February 2016} and \textbf{September 2022} as two periods where Tonga's nominal exchange rates (e) and foreign reserves (fxr) fluctated abnormally as to indicate a crisis. For february 2016, i gather there was a large-scale non-performing loan cancellation from the bank for the agricultural sector  due to the failure in exports for the squash sector.

For September 2022, 

\section{Foreign Reserve Adequacy}
Tonga’s official foreign reserves are slowly 
declining but still remained well above 
minimum adequacy thresholds providing 
continued support for external stability.
Foreign reserves declined in the year to 
February 2025 by 2.9 percent ($26.0 m) to 
$865.4m. The annual decline in foreign 
reserves corresponds to the higher outflows 
for import payments, offshore investments, 
and repayments of external debt. The 
current level of foreign reserves is 
equivalent to 9.9 months of imports 
coverage, lower than the 11.5 months of

imports coverage in February 2024. Nonetheless, the current level of foreign reserves is still above the 
IMF prescribed level of 7.5 months of imports cover, and the NRBT’s minimum threshold of 3 months 
of imports cover. 
The announcement of AUD\$85m and other donor funds to be received in the next few years would also 
help maintain the level of foreign reserves. However, the anticipated increase in import payments 
relative to the anticipated gradual slowdown in foreign aid and remittances are expected to gradually 
reduce the level of foreign reserves. Foreign reserves are mostly held in USD, AUD, and NZD. The 
outlook for foreign reserves is expected to remain comfortable in the near to medium-term and ongoing 
monitoring is essential to ensure the foreign reserves remain sufficient amid external pressures

       Doing an EBA analysis of country Poland, we evaluate their REER gap is -7.3\% which was in alignment with IMF’s article IV EBA results for 2024. This implied their currency was undervalued and needed to appreciate by 7.3\% in real terms to close the CA\_gap of 1.5\% - which came from the cyclical components of trade\_openness \\

\subsection{ST25.36 Exchange Rate Policy}

For ST25.36, the course focused on key exchange rate rate concepts (real, nominal, bilateral, multilateral, spot, forward) and arbitrage conditions (UIP, law of one price, PPP, relative PPP); its role in achieving internal and external balance (adjustment to overall equilibrium under floating and fixed exchange rate regimes); its role in economic growth (undervaluation, Washington Consensus, the Balassa-Samuelson effect).

Exchange rate policy and regimes (taxonomy, impossible trinity) and associated policy mix (monetary policy independence, financial stability, fiscal policy, capital controls).  

Practical Problems of Exchange Rate Policy in Developing and Emerging Market Economies (concerns of excessive volatility; de jure vs. de facto regimes; competitiveness, price stability; exchange-rate pass-through; targets and instruments).  

Transitions from rigid to flexible exchange rates regimes (motives; speed of transition; deep and liquid domestic FX markets, derivatives markets, coherent intervention policy, nominal anchor; transition sequence).   
FX interventions (sterilized or non-sterilized; motivations, channels, effectiveness, instruments, tactics, policy communication).  

The learnings of this paper will be applied in the context of \textbf{Tonga}.
